        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>John F. Kennedy once said, "Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other." As a high schooler, I embody this timeless wisdom, constantly exploring new horizons and embracing challenges with unwavering dedication. As a hiker, photographer, and lover of our preserved lands, I find solace and inspiration in the beauty of the natural world, embarking on unforgettable adventures that shape my character.

Passionate about both the environment and leadership, I express myself through various facets, from politics to service, and from the lens of my camera to the pursuit of knowledge. Coming from a long line of civil servants, leadership runs deep in my veins, and I seize every challenge as an opportunity to apply my grit and problem-solving skills.

As an advocate for environmentalism and justice, I strive to make a tangible impact on our planet's well-being. Whether I'm championing the cause of our ECO Club or navigating the intricate terrain of birding, I am resolute in my dedication to protecting our environment and ensuring a sustainable future.

Beyond my environmental pursuits, I'm an active member of my school community. Serving as Co-Captain of the Varsity Baseball Team, I bring my leadership skills to the field, fostering teamwork and a competitive spirit. Simultaneously, as Vice President of the Student Council and Historian for Junior State of America, I contribute to shaping the future of our society through democratic engagement and civic discourse.

Recognized for my academic excellence, I hold a GPA of 3.88 (UW) and 4.81 (W), a testament to my commitment to intellectual growth and pursuit of knowledge. Additionally, I'm honored to be a member of the National Honor Society and Rotary's Interact, embracing service as a means to make a positive impact in my community.

Looking ahead, I envision myself studying Wildlife Ecology, Economics, and Political Science in college, where I can deepen my understanding of the environment and develop the skills necessary to address its challenges effectively. Ultimately, I aspire to embark on a career in public service or baseball operations, leveraging my passion, leadership, and problem-solving abilities to create a profound and lasting impact on others.

If you share my passion for environmentalism, leadership, or simply wish to connect, I welcome you to reach out to me via email at s1705256@online.houstonisd.org. Together, let us explore the untrodden paths, embrace the power of nature, and shape a brighter future for generations to come.</p>
